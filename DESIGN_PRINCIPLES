# Design Principles for grapht/Claude Code Lens

A living document of design philosophy, best practices, and specific guidelines for building beautiful, precise analytics interfaces.

---

## Core Philosophy

### The "Precise and Weighty" Principle
Digital interfaces should feel substantial and tactile, like physical instruments rather than floating abstractions.

**Key qualities:**
- Mass and friction in interactions
- Purposeful movement and transitions
- Solid, grounded visual presence
- Minimal but meaningful decoration

**Anti-patterns:**
- Floaty, weightless interactions
- Excessive animation without purpose
- Generic "tech" styling (purple gradients, glows, glass morphism)
- Abstraction that distances user from their data

---

## Visual Design Rules

### Color
- **Use fewer colors** - Most designs use too many; limit your palette
- **Avoid AI aesthetic clichés** - No purple gradients, excessive glows, or generic blue/purple tech styling
- **High contrast** - Low contrast makes interfaces hard to use
- **Strategic color** - Color should have meaning, not just decoration

### Typography
- **Increase font sizes** - Text is usually too small
- **Increase font weight** - Thin fonts lack presence
- **Use system fonts** - Custom fonts often load poorly or look worse
- **Use fewer typefaces** - Stick to 1-2 fonts maximum
- **Increase line height** - Tight line spacing hurts readability

### Layout & Spacing
- **Add more whitespace** - Designs are typically too cramped
- **Generous margins** - Let content breathe
- **Reduce decorative elements** - Every element should serve a purpose

### Visual Effects
- **Reduce drop shadows** - Overuse makes designs look dated
- **Reduce border radius** - Overly rounded corners look unprofessional
- **Minimal glass morphism** - Use sparingly if at all
- **No gratuitous glows** - Light should have a source and purpose

## Interaction Design

### Movement & Transitions
- **Weighted interactions** - Nothing should feel instantaneous or floaty
- **Purposeful animation** - Movement should communicate meaning
- **Consistent timing** - Establish and maintain timing curves
- **Directional awareness** - Transitions should respect spatial relationships

### Feedback
- **Immediate response** - User actions get instant acknowledgment
- **State clarity** - Always clear what is active, selected, or available
- **Progressive disclosure** - Complexity revealed as needed
- **Tactile feedback** - Interactions should feel responsive and solid

## Data Visualization Principles

### From The Pudding
1. **Entry points matter** - Give users a personal stake in the data
2. **Iteration is everything** - First pass is never good enough
3. **Interactivity should be meaningful** - Not decoration
4. **Methods transparency builds trust**
5. **Single-point thesis** - Clear message, not just exploratory tool

### Interaction Patterns
- **Progressive disclosure** - Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Personalization via survey** - Plot user's position in visualizations
- **Annotation strategy** - Highlight key shifts, link to context
- **Color coding** - Consistent categories throughout
- **Tooltips** - Details on demand, not always visible

### Chart Design
- **Purpose-driven** - Every chart answers a specific question
- **Accessible** - Colorblind modes, screen reader support
- **Mobile-first** - Plan mobile experience from the start
- **Performance** - Smooth even with large datasets

## Material & Texture Inspiration

### Physical Materials
- **Fine leather goods** - Grain patterns, natural texture
- **Wood furniture** - Visible grain, solid construction
- **Precision instruments** - Weighted controls, smooth movement
- **Artisan craftsmanship** - Quality you can see and feel

### Luxury Dashboards
- **Automotive inspiration** - Ferrari, Lamborghini, Rolls Royce instrument clusters
- **Precision and luxury** - Every detail considered
- **Analog meets digital** - Physical metaphors in digital space
- **Tactile quality** - Even visual elements should feel substantial

### Game UI Examples
**Diegetic UI (integrated into world):**
- Dead Space - Health bar on spine, holographic inventory
- Metro series - Watch-based UI, physical map checking
- Alien: Isolation - Motion tracker, chunky mechanical aesthetic

**Weighted interactions:**
- Destiny (Bungie) - Legendary weapon feel, "30 seconds of fun"
- DOOM (2016/Eternal) - Snappy but weighted weapon switching
- Ghost of Tsushima - Guiding Wind system, natural minimalism

**Data visualization:**
- Hitman 3 - Sophisticated mission briefing overlays
- Watch Dogs 2 - Grounded cyberpunk hacking visuals
- The Division - Military-grade holographic interfaces

## Design System References

### Timeless Design Systems to Study
- **Swiss design** - Dieter Rams, Braun products
- **Japanese minimalism** - Muji philosophy
- **Apple's design system** - Precision and restraint
- **Bungie's UI/UX** - Destiny's design language

### Key Principles from These Systems
- **Less, but better** (Rams)
- **Honest materials** - Don't fake physicality
- **Functional beauty** - Form follows function
- **Restraint** - Know when to stop adding

## Competitive Differentiation

### What We Are NOT
- Utilitarian enterprise dashboards (Paid.ai, etc.)
- Generic observability platforms
- AI-generated "tech" aesthetic
- One-size-fits-all solutions

### What We ARE
- Beautifully crafted personal analytics
- Interactive exploration tools
- Design-forward developer tools
- Premium experience for users who notice details

### Our Unique Value
- **Craftsmanship over features** - Fewer things, done incredibly well
- **Interactive storytelling** - Help users discover patterns, not just report them
- **Aesthetic quality** - For developers who appreciate beautiful tools
- **Personal analytics** - Focus on individual insight, not team surveillance

## Implementation Guidelines

### When Building Visualizations
1. Sketch whiteboard version first
2. Define single-point thesis
3. Identify "aha" moment
4. Plan personalization hook
5. Prototype quickly (Python/matplotlib)
6. Iterate extensively (this is where quality happens)
7. Build production version (D3.js/Svelte)
8. Polish interactions and transitions
9. Test on actual devices
10. Add methods transparency

### When Evaluating Designs
Ask:
- Does this feel precise and weighty?
- Is every element purposeful?
- Would this work on mobile?
- Does it avoid AI aesthetic clichés?
- Is it beautiful AND functional?
- Does it help users understand their data?
- Would I be proud to show this?

## Technical Approach

### Stack for Achieving These Principles
- **SvelteKit** - Production framework
- **D3.js** - Custom visualizations with full control
- **LayerCake** - Svelte-D3 integration
- **Scrollama** - Scroll-driven storytelling
- **System fonts** - Load fast, look professional
- **Minimal dependencies** - Every library must earn its place

### Image Generation
- **[Nano Banana (Gemini) Skill](https://github.com/EveryInc/every-marketplace/tree/d44804fc39d60bb7914d971cc90bdb98e3b3e710/plugins/compounding-engineering/skills/gemini-imagegen)** - For generating visual assets and mockups
  - **Cartography use case:** Excellent for turning low-res satellite imagery into detailed hand-drawn maps and vector HD maps ([example](https://x.com/bilawalsidhu/status/1991635734546284703))
  - Segments terrain, recovers hidden paths/roads under tree cover
  - More detailed than Google basemap in many regions
  - **Recommendation:** Use for any map-based visualizations in grapht

### Performance Requirements
- Smooth 60fps interactions
- Fast initial load
- Progressive enhancement
- Works on mobile devices
- Accessible by default
